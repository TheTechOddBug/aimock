# Live API Drift Detection

aimock produces responses shaped like real LLM APIs. Providers change their APIs over time. **Drift** means the mock no longer matches reality — your tests pass against aimock but break against the real API.

## Three-Layer Approach

Drift detection compares three independent sources to triangulate the cause of any mismatch:

| SDK types = Real API? | Real API = aimock? | Diagnosis                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes                   | No                 | **aimock drift** — response builders need updating                   |
| No                    | No                 | **Provider changed before SDK update** — flag, wait for SDK catch-up |
| Yes                   | Yes                | **No drift** — all clear                                             |
| No                    | Yes                | **SDK drift** — provider deprecated something SDK still references   |

Two-way comparison (mock vs real) can't distinguish between "we need to fix aimock" and "the SDK hasn't caught up yet." Three-way comparison can.

## Running Drift Tests

```bash
# All providers (requires all three API keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... GOOGLE_API_KEY=... pnpm test:drift

# Single provider (others skip automatically)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... pnpm test:drift

# Strict mode — warnings also fail
STRICT_DRIFT=1 OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... pnpm test:drift
```

Required environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — OpenAI API key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Anthropic API key
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — Google AI API key

Each provider's tests skip independently if its key is not set. You can run drift tests for just one provider.

## Reading Results

### Severity levels

- **critical** — Test fails. aimock produces a different shape than the real API for a field that both the SDK and real API agree on. This means aimock needs an update.
- **warning** — Test passes (unless `STRICT_DRIFT=1`). The real API has a field that neither the SDK nor aimock knows about, or the SDK and real API disagree. Usually means a provider added something new.
- **info** — Always passes. Known intentional differences (usage fields are always zero, optional fields aimock omits, etc.).

### Example report output

```
API DRIFT DETECTED: OpenAI Chat Completions (non-streaming text)

  1. [critical] LLMOCK DRIFT — field in SDK + real API but missing from mock
     Path:    usage.completion_tokens_details
     SDK:     object { reasoning_tokens: number }
     Real:    object { reasoning_tokens: number, accepted_prediction_tokens: number }
     Mock:    <absent>

  2. [warning] PROVIDER ADDED FIELD — in real API but not in SDK or mock
     Path:    system_fingerprint
     SDK:     <absent>
     Real:    string
     Mock:    <absent>

  3. [info] MOCK EXTRA FIELD — in mock but not in real API
     Path:    choices[0].logprobs
     SDK:     null | object
     Real:    <absent>
     Mock:    null
```

## Fixing Detected Drift

When a `critical` drift is detected:

1. **Identify the response builder** — the report path tells you which provider and field:
   - OpenAI Chat Completions → `src/helpers.ts` (`buildTextCompletion`, `buildToolCallCompletion`, `buildTextChunks`, `buildToolCallChunks`)
   - OpenAI Responses API → `src/responses.ts` (`buildTextResponse`, `buildToolCallResponse`, `buildTextStreamEvents`, `buildToolCallStreamEvents`)
   - Anthropic Claude → `src/messages.ts` (`buildClaudeTextResponse`, `buildClaudeToolCallResponse`, `buildClaudeTextStreamEvents`, `buildClaudeToolCallStreamEvents`)
   - Google Gemini → `src/gemini.ts` (`buildGeminiTextResponse`, `buildGeminiToolCallResponse`, `buildGeminiTextStreamChunks`, `buildGeminiToolCallStreamChunks`)
   - Gemini embedContent → `src/gemini.ts` (embedContent response builder)
   - Gemini Interactions → `src/gemini-interactions.ts` (`buildInteractionsTextResponse`, `buildInteractionsToolCallResponse`, `buildInteractionsTextSSEEvents`, `buildInteractionsToolCallSSEEvents`)
   - OpenAI Image Edit → `src/images.ts` (multipart `/v1/images/edits` handler)
   - OpenAI Audio Translation → `src/transcription.ts` (multipart `/v1/audio/translations` handler)
   - Ollama Embeddings → `src/ollama.ts` (`/api/embed` + legacy `/api/embeddings` response builder)
   - Cohere Embed → `src/cohere.ts` (`/v2/embed` response builder)
   - ElevenLabs TTS → `src/elevenlabs-audio.ts` (`/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}` response builder)

2. **Update the builder** — add or modify the field to match the real API shape.

3. **Run conformance tests** — `pnpm test` to verify existing API conformance tests still pass.

4. **Run drift tests** — `pnpm test:drift` to verify the drift is resolved.

## Model Deprecation

`models.drift.ts` normalizes each provider's live `GET /models` listing to family keys and subtracts the frozen classification in `model-registry.ts`. Two directions fall out of that subtraction: a live family we do not classify (**new family** — see the automated sync below), and a classified family the listing no longer contains (**deprecation**).

**A deprecation needs nothing from you.** The daily sync records it in `deprecatedFamilies` and aimock keeps mocking the family, so clients pinned to a retired model id keep working. The only thing worth doing by hand is the cheap live test model: if `src/__tests__/drift/providers.ts` names a model that no longer exists, the live drift legs cannot run at all, so point them at a current one and re-run `pnpm test:drift`.

## Adding a New Provider

1. Add the provider's SDK as a devDependency in `package.json`
2. Add shape extraction functions to `src/__tests__/drift/sdk-shapes.ts`
3. Add raw fetch client functions to `src/__tests__/drift/providers.ts`
4. Create `src/__tests__/drift/<provider>.drift.ts` with 4 test scenarios
5. Add model listing function to `providers.ts` and model check to `models.drift.ts`
6. If the provider uses WebSocket, add protocol functions to `ws-providers.ts` and create `ws-<provider>.drift.ts`
7. Update the allowlist in `schema.ts` if needed

## WebSocket Drift Coverage

Alongside the 23 core drift tests (20 HTTP response-shape + 3 model deprecation), these endpoints are covered too:

### Additional Endpoint Drift Coverage

| Endpoint                                 | Provider      | Type              | Status  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| POST /v1beta/models/{model}:embedContent | Gemini        | HTTP              | Covered |
| POST /v1/images/edits                    | OpenAI        | HTTP (multipart)  | Covered |
| POST /v1/audio/translations              | OpenAI        | HTTP (multipart)  | Covered |
| POST /api/embed, /api/embeddings         | Ollama        | HTTP              | Covered |
| POST /v2/embed                           | Cohere        | HTTP              | Covered |
| POST /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}       | ElevenLabs    | HTTP              | Covered |
| stream_options.include_usage             | OpenAI        | Streaming feature | Covered |
| x-ratelimit-\* / Retry-After 429         | All providers | Response headers  | Covered |

WebSocket drift tests cover aimock's WS protocols (6 verified + 2 canary = 8 WS tests):

### Gemini Interactions API (Beta)

The Gemini Interactions API (`/v1beta/interactions`) is covered by 4 drift tests in `gemini-interactions.drift.ts`:

- Non-streaming text shape
- Streaming text event sequence
- Non-streaming tool call shape
- Streaming tool call event sequence

Uses `describe.skipIf(!GOOGLE_API_KEY)` like other Gemini tests. The Interactions API is in Beta — shapes may shift as Google iterates on the endpoint.

| Protocol               | Text | Tool Call | Real Endpoint                                                       | Status     |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| OpenAI Responses WS    | ✓    | ✓         | `wss://api.openai.com/v1/responses`                                 | Verified   |
| OpenAI Realtime (GA)   | ✓    | ✓         | `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`                                  | Verified   |
| OpenAI Realtime (Beta) | ✓    | ✓         | `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime` + `OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1`     | Verified   |
| Gemini Live            | —    | —         | `wss://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/ws/...BidiGenerateContent` | Unverified |

**Models**: `gpt-4o-mini` for Responses WS, `gpt-realtime-2` for Realtime GA (was `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`).

**GA Realtime Drift Tests**:

- **Model canary** — Verifies GA models exist (`gpt-realtime`, `gpt-realtime-2`, `gpt-realtime-1.5`, `gpt-realtime-mini` and dated snapshots) and flags unknown realtime models
- **Protocol probe** — Connects with both GA and Beta protocol, normalizes event sequences, and verifies consistency
- **Event shape validation** — GA event names (`response.output_text.delta`, `conversation.item.added`, `conversation.item.done`) and nested session config (`session.audio.*`, `session.type`, `session.reasoning`)

**Auth**: Uses the same `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variables as HTTP tests. No new secrets needed.

**How it works**: A TLS WebSocket client (`ws-providers.ts`) connects to real provider endpoints using `node:tls` with RFC 6455 framing. Each protocol function handles the setup sequence (e.g., Realtime session negotiation, Gemini Live setup/setupComplete) and collects messages until a terminal event. The mock side uses the existing `ws-test-client.ts` plaintext client against the local aimock server.

### Gemini Live: graded on the AUDIO modality

aimock's Gemini Live handler implements the `BidiGenerateContent` protocol as documented in Google's [Live API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api/live) — `setup`/`setupComplete` handshake, `clientContent` with turns, `serverContent` with `modelTurn.parts[]`, and `toolCall` responses.

A Live session carries exactly ONE response modality, and every model exposing `bidiGenerateContent` is a native-audio model that supports only `AUDIO` — Google's [capabilities guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/capabilities) states the native audio models "only support `AUDIO` response modality". A session requesting `TEXT` is refused with an RFC 6455 CLOSE frame (`code=1007`, "The requested combination of response modalities (TEXT) is not supported by the model"), so `ws-gemini-live.drift.ts` drives `responseModalities: ["AUDIO"]` and grades the audio event sequence — `inlineData` parts plus `turnComplete` — along with the modality-independent `toolCall`. The mock side is driven by an audio fixture so both sides of the comparison see the same modality.

Model selection keys ONLY on the listing's declared `bidiGenerateContent` support. It must never re-derive a capability from the model name: a `"native-audio"` name-substring filter previously mis-classified `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` — a native-audio model that omits that substring from its name — as text-capable, which is how the leg came to request an unsupported modality.

aimock's TEXT `serverContent` path is exercised mock-only by `ws-gemini-live.test.ts`; it cannot be triangulated against a live endpoint while no Live model serves text. `ws-gemini-live-modality.test.ts` runs the whole three-way comparison locally against a fake provider that enforces Google's modality rule, so the mock side is verified without live credentials.

## CI Schedule

Drift tests run on a schedule:

- **Daily**: 6:00 AM UTC
- **Manual**: Trigger via GitHub Actions UI (`workflow_dispatch`)
- **NOT** on PR or push — these tests hit real APIs and cost money

See `.github/workflows/test-drift.yml`.

## Automated Drift Remediation

There is no LLM/agent in the remediation loop. General (non-model-churn) drift
is **not** auto-fixed by anything — it is caught by the daily drift test (which
alerts on its own; see above) and fixed by a human like any other bug. The only
automated remediation is the deterministic, zero-LLM **model-family sync**,
which handles exactly one class of drift: a provider adding or retiring a
model family. The `fix-drift.yml` workflow runs it on `workflow_dispatch` and a
daily **scheduled cron** (independent of drift-test failure — a retired model
family does not, by itself, fail the drift tests):

1. **Sync** — `scripts/drift-sync.ts` fetches each provider's live `/models` listing directly and diffs it against the frozen classification in `src/__tests__/drift/model-registry.ts`:
   - a classified family a healthy live listing no longer contains → **a provider-confirmed deprecation is a fact, not a decision**, so it never routes to a human. drift-sync RECORDS it, mechanically, as a comment-marked entry in `deprecatedFamilies[provider]` (`model-registry.ts`), stamped with the date and with whether aimock's own source still references it. **The mock keeps serving**: `includeFamilies` is untouched, so every builder and fixture for that family still answers — users pin retired model ids in their own suites for years, and the upstream catalog shrinking is not a reason to break them. Recording it is also what makes it stop: the detector filters recorded families out of its candidate set, so the same retirement is not re-derived every morning for ever. Dropping a retired family from aimock altogether stays optional human cleanup (delete it from `includeFamilies` **and** `deprecatedFamilies`, then re-pin `DATA_FROZEN["includeFamilies.<provider>"]` in `logic-pin.test.ts`, all in one reviewed commit) — the re-pin is the reviewed decision the pin exists to force, which the sync's own changed-file allowlist forbids it from making. Nothing is broken while it is undone.
   - a genuinely new/unclassified family, or a registry structural mismatch (the AST locator could not find the array it had to edit) → **not** auto-applied: the decision itself is a human's. A family-keyed dedup note file is written under `drift-proposals/` and the run is routed to a human (no PR spam on re-fire)
2. **Gate** — `scripts/drift-sync-check.ts` re-verifies any mechanical edit before (inside `drift-sync.ts`) and after (workflow defense-in-depth) it is kept: a changed-file allowlist (only `model-registry.ts` data literals + `drift-proposals/` notes), a checksum-pin re-assert over the frozen classification logic, and a clean re-collect. `deprecatedFamilies` is the one registry set deliberately **not** membership-pinned — a pin on the ledger the sync appends to would red on the sync's own append and revert it, every morning, forever. It gates no alert a human sees (`isClassifiedFamily` does not consult it), so there is nothing for a pin to defend; its invariants are asserted behaviourally in `model-registry.test.ts` instead.
3. **PR** — the workflow opens a pull request for a human to review + merge (never auto-merged), unless an open PR already proposes the same changeset or a human has already rejected it. There are two distinct PR classes:
   - **`ok-applied`** — a successful mechanical registry edit: a recorded **deprecation**, or an **addition** a human already approved on a prior run. Pushed onto the `fix/drift-*` branch `drift-sync.ts` committed onto; a human reviews CI + the diff and merges. No alert, no red run — it is data-only bookkeeping.
   - **`needs-human`** — a routed decision, and now only a genuinely new/unclassified family or a registry structural mismatch. `drift-sync.ts` commits the `drift-proposals/` note file(s), and the workflow pushes a **distinct `drift-needs-human/*` branch** and opens a PR so the note lands in the repo (the job also goes RED + Slack-alerts so the decision is seen). The PR is **never auto-merged**. To approve a _new-family_ note, set its `Decision: include` line and **merge the PR**; the **next** drift-sync run reads the approved note from `main` and applies the mechanical registry edit (an `ok-applied` PR). That two-run hand-off is how the loop closes.

   **Closing a drift-sync PR REJECTS that changeset, permanently.** A CLOSED-but-never-merged PR carrying the `<!-- drift-changeset: <key> -->` marker tells the workflow a human decided against that exact changeset, so it stops re-proposing it (a genuinely different drift hashes to a different key and is unaffected; a **merged** PR is an accepted decision and is never read as a rejection). A still-**open** PR carrying the marker always wins over a closed one, so closing a duplicate does not reject the changeset the surviving PR is still proposing. The suppression is **not silent, and not repetitive** — the first run after the closure posts a Slack line naming the closing PR, then records an ack marker in that PR's body so the identical line is not re-posted every morning for as long as the rejection stands (which is for ever: the closure is permanent and the changeset key is date-independent). Delete that ack marker and the next run reports the suppression again. **To un-suppress: REOPEN that PR** — it becomes the pending proposal again, and the registry stays drifted until you do. Deleting the `<!-- drift-changeset: … -->` marker from the closed PR's body does **not** un-suppress: the marker self-heal now covers closed PRs and puts it back, because that marker going missing is far more often a human rewriting the body (to write down _why_ they declined) than a deliberate un-suppression — and losing it that way used to resurrect the rejected changeset every morning, permanently. Reopening is the deliberate act; a body edit is not.

   Editing markers out of a drift-sync PR does nothing, on the other hand: the workflow restores the markers it owns on the PRs it can recognise as its own, warns in the run log, and dedups normally. That repair reaches a **closed** PR's changeset marker too — which is what makes closing one a durable rejection, since a later body edit can no longer erase the record of it. A **merged** PR is left alone: an accepted decision is neither a pending proposal nor a rejection, so nothing there is read and nothing is written.

   **"No churn" is not the same as "could not look".** Several things make `drift-sync.ts` SKIP a provider rather than fail: an unusable credential (a missing key, or a 401/402/403), and a live `/models` listing that comes back with fewer raw ids than `MIN_LISTING_SIZE[provider]` (a partial response, or an API that changed shape — the deprecation half then refuses to mass-remove off it). That floor is an explicit per-provider number, set below the smallest healthy listing there is evidence for. It is deliberately NOT the number of families aimock mocks: comparing raw ids against a family count is a unit mismatch, and it ratcheted anthropic's floor to 20 against a live listing of 11, abandoning that provider's deprecation half on every run for weeks while each one reported a quiet day. With nothing to diff the run reports `ok-no-churn` and exits 0, indistinguishable from a genuinely quiet day. So the sync prints a machine line, `unchecked-providers=<csv>`, and the workflow reclassifies such a run to `provider-unchecked`: the job goes RED and Slack points at the `[skipped] <provider>: <reason>` lines of the drift-sync-log artifact. Only **transient** classes (a 429 or a 5xx) are tolerated, and that is an allowlist of the tolerated class — not of the faults — so a skip class added later counts as unchecked by default instead of silently reading as "checked fine". An unreadable log, or a missing `unchecked-providers=` line, is treated as a fault too — an unprovable run must not pass as a quiet one.

   **Re-fires never spam a second PR — idempotent in every run shape.** Because a drift-sync PR is never auto-merged, an un-merged drift is re-detected on every daily cron run. Both PR classes therefore dedup on a **stable changeset key**: `drift-sync.ts` emits a date-independent `changeset-key` (a hash of the sorted set of applied + deferred family outcomes, independent of the date-stamped comment text and the run-id branch name), and each PR body carries a `<!-- drift-changeset: <key> -->` marker. Before opening a PR, the workflow skips if an open PR already carries that marker. This covers the **mixed run** — a mechanical removal of one family committed the same run a _different_ family is deferred to a human (its note already on `main`) — whose committed diff is a registry edit with **no new note file**: a note-path-only key would be empty there and let a new PR open every day. A run that produces no new commit at all (note already on `main`, nothing applied) pushes nothing. The older per-note `drift-proposal-note: <path>` body marker is retained, but as a **notice, not a guard**: it used to skip the whole run on the first note some open PR already proposed, which silently discarded the _rest_ of that run (a mixed run's registry edit, or a second note added since). Control only reaches it once the changeset key has found nothing, so the run's content is by then known to be un-proposed and standing down could only lose it. So the overlap is now logged as a warning — two open PRs carrying one note is worth explaining — and the run proceeds.

### Artifacts

- `drift-report.json` (test-drift.yml) / `drift-sync-log`, `drift-sync-check-log` (fix-drift.yml) — structured/plaintext run output (retained 30 days)

## Cost

~31 API calls per run (20 HTTP response-shape + 3 model listing + 8 WS) using the cheapest available models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-realtime-2`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `gemini-2.5-flash`) with 10-100 max tokens each. Under $0.25/week at daily cadence. The GA protocol probe adds a second Realtime WS connection (one GA, one Beta) per run. The 2 Gemini Live legs each open a real WS session and generate a short audio turn.
