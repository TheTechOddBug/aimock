 * Drift Report Collector

 * Runs the drift test suite via subprocess with JSON reporter, parses the

 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — no critical diffs found (or no drift at all)
 *   2 — at least one critical diff exists
 *   5 — at least one failure was quarantined (unparseable/untrusted — needs review)
 *   6 — at least one live leg timed out having observed ZERO messages: the
 *       surface went silent, so nothing was graded there. Not drift, not a
 *       collector fault, and NOT a clean baseline.
 *   1 — AG-UI drift detection was skipped (infra), or an unhandled script error

// applied UNIFORMLY by `anchorInfraIndicator` below, so no single indicator can
// be individually mis-anchored and a phrase added to this list later is
// automatically anchored the same way as its siblings.
//
// The anchor requires the phrase to BE the failure reason at the START of a

// ones), followed by a word boundary. This means a genuine infra REASON like
// `empty response`, `fetch failed`, or `API returned 503` at line start still
// classifies as infra, while a labelled drift-body VALUE like
// `     Real: API returned 503` / `     Real:    empty response` can NEVER trip
// the gate (the phrase is not at the line start, it follows a `Field:` label).

 *
 * Precedence (highest first):
 *   - `criticalCount > 0`  → 2  — at least one trustworthy critical drift.
 *   - `quarantineCount > 0`→ 5  — a failure could not be parsed/mapped into a
 *                                 trustworthy finding and was held for review;
 *                                 distinct from a critical (2) and from a clean
 *                                 pass (0) so it is never silently swallowed.
 *   - `agUiSkipped`        → 1  — AG-UI drift detection could not run (infra).
 *                                 O2: AG-UI-skipped stays exit 1 (unchanged).
 *   - otherwise            → 0  — no drift.
 *
 * Critical wins over quarantine: if the run found a genuine critical drift, that
 * is the actionable signal even if some other failure was also quarantined.
