/**
 * Assertions on the Ollama provisioning step of .github/workflows/test-drift.yml.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARDS. The `drift` job provisions a local Ollama daemon so the
 * OLLAMA_HOST-gated live leg runs. That provisioning is the only place in the
 * job that fetches third-party BYTES over the network and executes them. Every
 * other executable in the job is already pinned: each `uses:` by commit SHA, and
 * `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` by the lockfile's own integrity hashes.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS HERE. The step holds no provider key of its own, and that is
 * NOT the property that protects the keys. It runs BEFORE `Preflight — provider
 * key freshness`'s successor steps and before `Run drift tests`, which is handed
 * OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, FAL_KEY,
 * COHERE_API_KEY and ELEVENLABS_API_KEY. Unverified bytes unpacked as root into
 * /usr/local plant a `node`/`npx`/`git` earlier on PATH (or a shell rc) that the
 * later, key-holding steps then execute. Ordering cannot fix that; only refusing
 * to unpack unverified bytes can.
 *
 * WHY THE QUESTION IS ABOUT `tar` AND `sh`, NOT ABOUT `curl`. A step that
 * "fails" AFTER handing a payload to an executor has refused nothing. The
 * harness below stubs both executors this step could reach — `sh` (the old
 * install-script path) and `tar` (the extractor) — and records WHAT each was
 * handed, so a refusal is the demonstrated ABSENCE of a payload at an executor
 * rather than an inference from an exit code.
 *
 * PINNING `ollama.com/install.sh` WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT, and this file
 * deliberately does not ask for it. That script streams an unversioned,
 * undigested `ollama-linux-<arch>.tar.zst` through `zstd -d` into `sudo tar -x`;
 * run verbatim out of the script's own reviewed bytes on 2026-08-05, attacker-
 * supplied content reached `sudo tar -xf - -C <dest>` and the script exited 0.
 * It cannot be fixed in place either — the script never holds the file, so it
 * has nothing to verify. So the release artifact is fetched directly from an
 * immutable release tag and digest-checked before anything unpacks it.
 *
 * The repo ships no YAML dependency and this suite adds none; the parser below
 * is scoped to one job's `steps:` sequence, and actionlint covers structural
 * validity separately in CI.
