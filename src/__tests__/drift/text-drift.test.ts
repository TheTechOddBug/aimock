/**

 * These live in a `*.test.ts` (the default `pnpm test` suite) rather than in

// (bare family + the dated snapshot form OpenAI actually lists).
//
// The `gpt-live` boundary is asserted in BOTH directions on purpose.
// `gpt-live` and `gpt-live-transcribe` are DIFFERENT families — the first is a
// genuinely unclassified family the canary must keep reporting (it is the
// canonical new-family example throughout this module), the second is an
// excluded transcription surface whose key has the first as a strict PREFIX.
// A substring/prefix-shaped classification bug would silently swallow the one
// family the canary exists to catch, and that exact shape has already been
// found in this codebase (a provider-label fallback where "Gemini Live
// Transcription session" resolved to `Transcription`), so it is not
// hypothetical.
