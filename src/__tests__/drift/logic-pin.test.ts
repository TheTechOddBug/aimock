/**
 * CHECKSUM FREEZE for the model-drift CLASSIFICATION logic (Phase-0, spec §6).
 *
 * These surfaces decide which live `/models` families count as drift. They are
 * the exact places a well-meaning bot — or an LLM told to "make the drift job
 * pass" — could SILENCE the canary with a one-line edit: broaden a normalizer
 * regex so unknown families collapse onto known ones, dump a new id into
 * `NON_MODEL_TOKENS`, add an exclude-by-rule pattern, or short-circuit
 * `isClassifiedFamily`. None of that must ever land silently.
 *
 * This test pins the SOURCE of each classification surface by SHA-256. Any edit
 * to a frozen surface flips its checksum and fails `pnpm test`, forcing the
 * change to be a deliberate, reviewed act: whoever legitimately changes a rule
 * must ALSO re-pin the checksum here (and explain why in the diff), which a
 * reviewer sees. A silent widening cannot slip through green CI.
 *
 * DO NOT "fix" a red pin by blindly pasting the new checksum. A red pin means a
 * frozen classification rule moved — confirm the move is intended and reviewed
 * BEFORE updating the pin. Auto-updating the pin to chase green defeats the
 * entire purpose of this file.
 *
 * Frozen surfaces — RULES, source-pinned in `FROZEN`:
 *   model-family.ts   — DATED_SNAPSHOT_SUFFIX, BUILD_TAG_SUFFIX,
 *                       ANTHROPIC_DATE_SUFFIX, normalizeModelFamily
 *   model-registry.ts — PREVIEW_FAMILY, GEMMA_FAMILY, NON_MODEL_TOKENS,
 *                       familySet, isClassifiedFamily
 *   voice-models.ts   — isVoiceModelId, normalizeVoiceModelFamily,
 *                       detectVoiceModelDrift
 *
 * Frozen surfaces — DATA, membership-pinned in `DATA_FROZEN`:
 *   model-registry.ts      — includeFamilies and excludeFamilies, per provider
 *   voice-models.ts        — knownVoiceModelFamilies, gaRealtimeModels
 *   deprecation-detector.ts — FORWARD_LOOKING_FAMILIES, per provider;
 *                             MIN_LISTING_SIZE (all three providers, one entry)
 *
 * Keep both lists exact. A guard whose own inventory is wrong is a false
 * record: it invites the reader to assume a surface is covered when it is not.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT FROZEN — `model-registry.ts`'s `deprecatedFamilies`.
 * DO NOT ADD IT. That set is the ledger `scripts/drift-sync.ts` APPENDS to,
 * unattended, every time a provider retires a family aimock mocks, and
 * `drift-sync-check`'s gate-2 re-runs this very file over the edited tree — so
 * a pin on it would red on the sync's own append, revert it, and leave the
 * deprecation to be re-derived and re-reverted every morning forever. The pin
 * and the ledger cannot both exist. Nothing is lost by leaving it out: a pin
 * defends against a one-line SILENCING edit, and an entry in `deprecatedFamilies`
 * silences no alert a human ever sees (it is not consulted by
 * `isClassifiedFamily`, so it cannot classify a live family or suppress a
 * new-family alert — it only stops a deprecation already recorded from being
 * re-recorded). Its invariants are asserted behaviourally in
 * `model-registry.test.ts` instead.

  // the fetcher (`providers.ts`'s `listOpenAIModels` → `.slice(0, 0)`) silences
  // the canary end-to-end with every pin, eslint and prettier still clean, and
  // an example-shaped callee anchor is itself defeated by a filter that keeps
  // the one example family and drops every other.
  //
  // Extending the pins cannot close that class, so the coverage is being
  // rebuilt in #349 as a fetch-stubbed end-to-end harness that drives the real
  // chain: with the fetch layer stubbed to return a listing containing an
  // unclassified family, the canary must produce a collector-routable
  // `API DRIFT DETECTED:` report. Silencing at ANY link — fetcher, gate, call
  // site or formatter — fails that harness, because it observes the OUTPUT of
  // the whole chain instead of the text of one link.

  // What remains in this repo meanwhile: the DETECTOR (`unclassifiedFamilies`)
  // is behaviourally covered — neutering it to `return []` reddens
  // `text-drift.test.ts`, the drift-sync mirror-equivalence guard, and its
  // co-located regressions under `test:drift` — and the classification RULES

  // — silently, on a green run, for as long as the listing stays under it. That

  // `includeFamilies[provider].size`, which put anthropic's at 20 against a
  // live listing of 11, and its deprecation half was skipped on 12 of 12 daily
  // runs with surviving artifacts while every one of them reported a quiet day.
  // Nothing pinned it, and the number moved 19 -> 20 in an ordinary
  // classify-a-family commit. Pinned as one entry (not per provider) because
  // the three numbers are chosen against each other — see MIN_LISTING_SIZE's
  // own doc for how each was derived from what is OBSERVED to clear.
