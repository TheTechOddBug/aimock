/**
 * Assertions on .github/workflows/fix-drift.yml.
 *
 * C3 (delete-freewriter-predicate-rewire): this workflow used to invoke an
 * autonomous coding-agent subprocess to freewrite a fix for whatever drift the
 * collector found, then gate the resulting diff behind a 916-line anti-cheat
 * verdict function (`scripts/drift-success-predicate.ts`) before opening a PR.
 * Both have been DELETED entirely. This suite (retargeted from the deleted
 * predicate-era assertions) pins the NEW, load-bearing wiring instead:
 *
 *   - the workflow triggers on workflow_dispatch and a SCHEDULED cron (the
 *     deprecation detector fires independently of drift-test failure — a
 *     vanished model family does not, by itself, red the Drift Tests
 *     workflow), and on AT MOST ONE trigger for a given Drift Tests failure
 *     (see the double-fire section below).
 *   - the "Auto-fix drift" step is replaced by `scripts/drift-sync.ts` (the
 *     deterministic, zero-LLM model-family sync core).
 *   - the "Assert drift truly resolved" step is replaced by
 *     `scripts/drift-sync-check.ts` (the trivial allowlist + pin + re-collect
 *     gate).
 *   - the PR-open path is gated on `reason == 'ok-applied'`, never on a
 *     verdict function.
 *   - the NO-AUTO-MERGE human-approval backstop is preserved verbatim (Phase
 *     0/1 — auto-merge is an explicit, opt-in Phase-4 exception, out of scope
 *     here).
 *   - there is NO remaining reference to the deleted predicate/LLM machinery.
 *   - a drift-sync CRASH is audible, and every Slack alert renders a real line
 *     break rather than the two characters `\n`.
 *
 * Most guards here are text-shape assertions on the committed workflow. The two
 * behavioural ones EXECUTE the step's own `run:` body under bash and read the
 * result, because no amount of pattern-matching can distinguish a literal `\n`
 * from a `${NL}` holding a newline, or tell whether a crashing sync leaves the
 * step green. The repo ships no YAML dependency and this suite adds none; an
 * actionlint run in CI covers structural validity separately.
